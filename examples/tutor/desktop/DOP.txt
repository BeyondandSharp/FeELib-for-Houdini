pyro

Multifield visualizes heat (flame) and density (smoke).
The source adds temperature and fuel to the simulation.
Where fuel exists and the temperature is above a certain point, "burn" is created.
Burn creates heat (visible flames).
Burn inefficiency leaves a certain percentage of fuel behind after burning.
Gas released = expansion
Cooling rate, dissipation
Velocity = start velocity + temperature * buoyancy
Advection affects temperature, heat, density, fuel*
In Houdini, temperature = buoyancy, velocity = momentum

Temperature is one of the most important fields for running a simulation (together with Velocity) and controls to great extend how the sim behaves and looks. Although it isn¡¯t often used for rendering and visualization, internally it drives many forces and shape operators (such as Buoyancy, Shredding and Dissipation).

When creating a fire sim, that control is extended to the combustion model. Temperature Diffusion and Cooling Rate act directly on the temperature field and offer great control over the simulation¡¯s decay in speed and simulated detail.
